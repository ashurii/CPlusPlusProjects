# CPlusPlusProjects
// The Node project contains files which utilize nodes of a linked list for data structures such as the Set and Bag.
// The Scheduler project contains two version of a cpu scheduler simulation. The first implements a priority queue using a doubly linked list
// And the second is a heap implementation for organizing the queue.
// The Dynamic Poly project is an implementation of a complex number/polynomial (eg. 2x^3+6x^2-4x), including common functions for calculating
// integrals, dirivatives, anti-dirivatives etc.
